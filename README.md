OVERVIEW
</p>

For my final project in the SNHU CS-499 Capstone, I demonstrated the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. The project involved selecting a previously developed program or set of programs and enhancing them in three key categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I chose to focus on a single program, applying enhancements across all three categories to showcase a comprehensive approach to software development.
